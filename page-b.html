			I studied pre-engineering at NTNU, which is the largest university in
			Norway. The university is located in Trondheim, which is knwon for it's
			good student culture. Every barber and hair salon has student discounts.
			Trondheim has bad weather.

			Drammen VGS had the best gym class because the school is next to
			Marienlyst soccer field. We also had a track and field arena where we
			could run.

			My highschool had the best vocational education, but right before i was
			supposed to start my apprenticeship, i went to NTNU to take a preperatory
			course for engineering student. When i went to NTNU i lived in Trondheim
			and ate pizza for breakfast, lunsj and dinner. Occasionally i would make
			tacos
